loginTest creates a sample form that enables and disables <span> "bubbles" dependant upon the Username and Password criteria entered by the user.
Jquery checks to see if the form has a Username entered, has a password more than 8 characters long, and that the confirm password field matches the password entered above.
If all criteria are met the "bubbles" dissapear and the submit button is enabled to send the information to the appropriate designation to be determined.
